# Description

This is a spells book for the modern witch or wizard! You are able to see all of your spells and add as many as you need!

We will be using React on the front end, Node and Express on the backend, and MongoDB for our database. The front end is mostly set up for you, but there are some functions for interacting with your server which will need to be added. The database has been created for you and will have some data in it already. The server has some bare functionality but more will need to be added.

### Getting Started

Run ```npm install```

Make sure mongodb is running on your machine, and then run ```npm run seed``` to seed your database with the beginning data.

Run ```npm run react-dev``` to get webpack running.

Run ```npm start``` to get server running.
